## AWS Mobile CLI  

AWS Amplify connects to AWS Mobile Hub to work with Amazon Web Services. You can use [awsmobile-cli](https://github.com/aws/awsmobile-cli) to create a new AWS Mobile Hub project or enable an existing project to work with AWS Mobile Hub. 

```bash
$ npm install -g awsmobile-cli
```

If it is the first time you are using `awsmobile-cli`, you need to configure the CLI with your AWS credentials. To setup permissions for the toolchain used by the CLI, run:

```bash
$ awsmobile configure
```

If prompted for credentials, follow the steps provided by the CLI. For more information, see [Provide IAM credentials to AWS Mobile CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-mobile/latest/developerguide/aws-mobile-cli-credentials.html).
