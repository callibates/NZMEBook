# Push Notifications

AWS Amplify Push Notifications module allows you to integrate push notifications in your app with Amazon Pinpoint targeting and campaign management support.

Push Notifications are currently supported only for *React Native*. For handling Web Push Notification with Service Workers, visit our [Service Workers Guide]({%if jekyll.environment == 'production'%}{{site.amplify.baseurl}}{%endif%}/media/service_workers_guide#handling-a-push-notification).
{: .callout .callout--info}

This guide provides a step-by-step introduction to start working with push notifications in React Native with Amazon Pinpoint. Amazon Pinpoint helps you to monitor your app's usage, create messaging campaigns targeted to specific user segments or demographics, and collect interaction metrics with push notifications. 

## Installation and Configuration

Setup instructions are provided for Android and iOS, and configuration for both platforms can be included on the same React Native project. 

### Requirements
1. In order to use Amazon Pinpoint you need to setup credentials (keys or certificates) for your targeted mobile platform; e.g.:Android and/or iOS.
2. Testing Push Notifications requires a physical device, because simulators or emulators wont' be able to handle push notifications.
3. Push Notification module is integrated with [AWS Amplify Analytics module]({%if jekyll.environment == 'production'%}{{site.amplify.baseurl}}{%endif%}/media/analytics_guide) to be able to track notifications. Make sure that you have configured the Analytics module in your app before configuring Push Notification module.
3. For setting up iOS push notifications, you need to download and install Xcode from [Apple Developer Center](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

### Setup for Android

1. Make sure you have a [Firebase Project](https://console.firebase.google.com) and app setup. 

2. Set up Android push notifications in Amazon Pinpoint Console. [Click here for instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/mobile-push-android.html).

3. Add your API key and Sender ID to AWS Pinpoint Console. [Click here for instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/getting-started-android-mobilehub.html).

4. Create and link a React Native app:
```bash
$ react-native init myapp
$ cd myapp
$ npm install aws-amplify --save && npm install aws-amplify-react-native --save
$ react-native link aws-amplify-react-native
$ react-native link amazon-cognito-identity-js #if you did not link it
```
That would install required npm modules and link React Native binaries.
*Please note that linking `aws-amplify-react-native` but not completing the rest of the configuration steps could break your build process. Please be sure that you have completed all the steps before you build your app.*

5. Enable your app in Firebase. To do that, follow those steps:
 - Visit the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com), and click the Gear icon next to **Project Overview** and click **Project Settings** Remember, if you don't have an existing project, you need to create one in order to continue
 - Click **Add App**, if you have an existing app you can skip this step
 - Choose **Add Firebase to your Android App**
 - Add your package name i.e. **com.myProjectName** and click **Register App**
 - Download  `google-services.json` file and copy it under your `android/app` project folder.
 Note: Please make sure you have this file in place or you won't pass the build process.
6. Open ```android/build.gradle```
    - Add ```classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:3.2.0'``` in the ```dependencies``` under ```buildscript```:
        ```gradle
        dependencies {
            classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:2.2.3'
            classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:3.2.0'  

            // NOTE: Do not place your application dependencies here; they belong
            // in the individual module build.gradle files
        }
```
Also update maven `url` as the following under  `allprojects` > `repositories`. Revise `allprojects` to be:
```gradle
    allprojects {
        repositories {
            mavenLocal()
            jcenter()
            maven {
                // All of React Native (JS, Obj-C sources, Android binaries) is installed from npm
                url "$rootDir/../node_modules/react-native/android"
            }
            maven {
                url "https://maven.google.com"
            }
        }
    }
```
7. Open `android/app/build.gradle`
    - Add firebase libs to the ```dependencies``` section
```gradle
dependencies {
 compile project(':aws-amplify-react-native')
 ..
 ..
 ..
 compile 'com.google.firebase:firebase-core:12.0.1'
 compile 'com.google.firebase:firebase-messaging:12.0.1'
}
```
    - Add following configuration to the bottom of the file.
```gradle
apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
``` 
8. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file and add the following configuration into `application` element.
```xml
    <application ... >

        <!--[START Push notification config -->
            <!-- [START firebase_service] -->
            <service
                android:name="com.amazonaws.amplify.pushnotification.RNPushNotificationMessagingService">
                <intent-filter>
                    <action android:name="com.google.firebase.MESSAGING_EVENT"/>
                </intent-filter>
            </service>
            <!-- [END firebase_service] -->
            <!-- [START firebase_iid_service] -->
            <service
                android:name="com.amazonaws.amplify.pushnotification.RNPushNotificationDeviceIDService">
                <intent-filter>
                    <action android:name="com.google.firebase.INSTANCE_ID_EVENT"/>
                </intent-filter>
            </service>
            <receiver
                android:name="com.amazonaws.amplify.pushnotification.modules.RNPushNotificationBroadcastReceiver"
                android:exported="false" >
                <intent-filter>
                    <action android:name="com.amazonaws.amplify.pushnotification.NOTIFICATION_OPENED"/>
                </intent-filter>
            </receiver>
        <!-- [END Push notification config -->

    </application>
```
9. Configure Push Notification module for your app as shown in [Configure your App](#configure-your-app) section.
10. Run your app with `yarn` or with an appropriate run command.
```bash
  $ yarn/npm run android
```

### Setup for IOS

1. Setup iOS Push Notifications and create a p12 certificate as instructed here in [Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/apns-setup.html).
 
2. Add your p12 certificate to AWS Mobile Hub console as instructed here in [Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/getting-started-ios-mobilehub.html).

3. Create and link a React Native app:
```js
$ react-native init myapp
$ cd myapp
$ npm install
$ npm install aws-amplify --save
$ npm install aws-amplify-react-native --save
$ react-native link aws-amplify-react-native
```
*Please note that linking `aws-amplify-react-native` but not completing the rest of the configuration steps could break your build process. Please be sure that you have completed all the steps before you build your app.*

4. Open `ios/myapp.xcodeproj` project file with Xcode.

5. Using Xcode, **manually link** the `PushNotificationIOS` library to your project. Please follow those steps in [React Native developer Documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/linking-libraries-ios.html#manual-linking) (Step 3 is not required)

6. Add the following code at the top on the file `AppDelegate.m`
```
#import <React/RCTPushNotificationManager.h>
```

7. And then in your `AppDelegate` implementation add the following code:
```c
// Required to register for notifications
 - (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didRegisterUserNotificationSettings:(UIUserNotificationSettings *)notificationSettings
 {
  [RCTPushNotificationManager didRegisterUserNotificationSettings:notificationSettings];
 }
 // Required for the register event.
 - (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(NSData *)deviceToken
 {
  [RCTPushNotificationManager didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:deviceToken];
 }
 // Required for the notification event. You must call the completion handler after handling the remote notification.
 - (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary *)userInfo
                                                        fetchCompletionHandler:(void (^)(UIBackgroundFetchResult))completionHandler
 {
   [RCTPushNotificationManager didReceiveRemoteNotification:userInfo fetchCompletionHandler:completionHandler];
 }
 // Required for the registrationError event.
 - (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:(NSError *)error
 {
  [RCTPushNotificationManager didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:error];
 }
 // Required for the localNotification event.
 - (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveLocalNotification:(UILocalNotification *)notification
 {
  [RCTPushNotificationManager didReceiveLocalNotification:notification];
 }
 ```

8. Update General App settings:
 - Make sure you have logged in with your Apple Developer account on Xcode
 - Set bundle identifier (with the one you create on your Apple Developer Account)
 - Unselect **Automatically manage signing** under **Signing** section
 - On Signing (Debug, Release) set the provisioning profile (created on your Apple Developer Account)

    <img src="{%if jekyll.environment == 'production'%}{{site.amplify.baseurl}}{%endif%}/media/images/capabilities.gif" style="display: block;height: auto;width: 100%;"/>

10. Configure Push Notification module for your app as shown in [Configure your App](#configure-your-app) section.

11. Run your app
 - On Xcode, select your device and run it first using as *Executable appName.app*. This will install the App on your device but it won't run it.
 - Select **Ask on Launch** for *Executable* option on menu chain *Product > Schema > Edit Scheme > Run > Info*.
 - Click *Run* button and select your app from the list.
 - In case the build fails, try cleaning the project with *shift + command + k*.

    *Following screencast shows the required app settings in Xcode:*
    <img src="{%if jekyll.environment == 'production'%}{{site.amplify.baseurl}}{%endif%}/media/images/runningApp.gif" style="display: block;height: auto;width: 100%;"/>

### Configure your App

Push Notification module is integrated with `Analytics` module to be able to track notifications. Make sure that you have configured the Analytics module in your app before configuring Push Notification module.  

If you don't have Analytics already enabled, see our [Analytics Developer Guide]({%if jekyll.environment == 'production'%}{{site.amplify.baseurl}}{%endif%}/media/analytics_guide) to add Analytics to your app.
{: .callout .callout--info}

First, import `PushNotification` module and configure it with `PushNotification.configure()`.

```js
import { PushNotificationIOS } from 'react-native';
import Amplify from 'aws-amplify';
import { PushNotification } from 'aws-amplify-react-native';

// PushNotification need to work with Analytics
Amplify.configure({
    Analytics: {
        // You configuration will come here...
    }
});

PushNotification.configure({
    // ...
    PushNotification: {
        appId: 'XXXXXXXXXXabcdefghij1234567890ab',
    }
    // ...
});
```

You can also use `aws-exports.js` file in case you have set up your backend with AWS Mobile Hub.

```js
import { PushNotificationIOS } from 'react-native';
import Amplify from 'aws-amplify';
import { PushNotification } from 'aws-amplify-react-native';
import aws_exports from './aws_exports';

// PushNotification need to work with Analytics
Amplify.configure(aws_exports);

PushNotification.configure(aws_exports);
```

## Working with the API

You can use `onNotification` and `onRegister` event handlers to work with push notifications in your app. The following code shows how you can retrieve the notification data and registration token:

```js
// get the notification data
PushNotification.onNotification((notification) => {
  // Note that the notification object structure is different from Android and IOS
  console.log('in app notification', notification);

  // required on iOS only (see fetchCompletionHandler docs: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/pushnotificationios.html)
  notification.finish(PushNotificationIOS.FetchResult.NoData);
});

// get the registration token
PushNotification.onRegister((token) => {
  console.log('in app registration', token);
});
```


## Testing Push Notifications 
Now, you can create messaging campaigns and send push notifications to your app with Amazon Pinpoint! Just follow these instructions on [Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/getting-started-sampletest.html) for the next steps.
