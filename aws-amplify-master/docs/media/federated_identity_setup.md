# Federated Identity Setup

## Enabling federated sign-in

Amplify's Authentication category uses AWS Cognito User Pools, which requires identity providers to be registered.  

If you are using Mobile Hub, you can register an identity provider by accessing the *User Sign-In* section and selecting the provider under the *Add sign-in Providers* section.

You may also register identity providers in *Amazon Cognito* console by selecting the related user pool and then accessing the *Federation > Identity providers* section.

### localhost domain

By default `localhost` is invalid in  **App Domains**.

You'll need to **Add Platform**, add **Website**. Then put the localhost URL in to **Site URL**

## Amazon

Note that the ```Security Profile id``` is for setting up the AWS Cognito identity pool and the ```Client Id``` is used in those HOC functions.
