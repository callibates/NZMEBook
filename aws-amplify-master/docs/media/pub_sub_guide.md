# PubSub

The AWS Amplify PubSub category provides connectivity with cloud-based message-oriented middleware. You can use PubSub to pass messages between your app instances and your app's backend creating real-time interactive experiences.

PubSub is available with **AWS IoT** and **Generic MQTT Over WebSocket Providers**. 

With AWS IoT, AWS Amplify's PubSub automatically signs your HTTP requests when sending your messages.

## Installation and Configuration

### AWS IoT

When used with `AwsIOTProvider`, PubSub is capable of signing request according to [Signature Version 4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html). 

To use in your app, import `AWSIoTProvider`:

```js
import Amplify, { PubSub } from 'aws-amplify';
import { AWSIoTProvider } from 'aws-amplify/lib/PubSub/Providers';
```

Define your endpoint and region in your configuration:

```js
// Apply plugin with configuration
Amplify.addPluggable(new AWSIoTProvider({
     aws_pubsub_region: '<YOUR-AWS-REGION>',
     aws_pubsub_endpoint: 'wss://xxxxxxxxxxxxx.iot.<YOUR-AWS-REGION>.amazonaws.com/mqtt',
   }));
```

**Create IAM policies for AWS IoT**

To use PubSub with AWS IoT, you will need to create the necessary IAM policies in the AWS IoT Console, and attach them to your Amazon Cognito Identity. 

Go to IoT Core and choose *Secure* from the left navigation pane. Then navigate to *Create Policy*. The following `myIOTPolicy` policy will allow full access to all the topics.

![Alt text](images/iot_attach_policy.png?raw=true "Title")


**Attach your policy to your Amazon Cognito Identity**

The next step is attaching the policy to your *Cognito Identity*. 

You can retrieve *Cognito Identity Id* from your `aws-exports.js` file in `aws_cognito_identity_pool_id` property. 

Alternatively, you can retrieve the `Cognito Identity Id` of a logged in user with Auth Module:
```js
    Auth.currentCredentials().then((info) => {
      const cognitoIdentityId = info._identityId;
    });
```

Then, you need to send your *Cognito Identity Id* to the AWS backend and attach `myIOTPolicy`. You can do this with the following [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) command:

```bash
aws iot attach-principal-policy --policy-name 'myIOTPolicy' --principal '<YOUR_COGNITO_IDENTITY_ID>'
```

### Third Party MQTT Providers

Import PubSub module and related service provider plugin to your app:

```js
import { PubSub } from 'aws-amplify';
import { MqttOverWSProvider } from "aws-amplify/lib/PubSub/Providers";
```

To configure your service provider with a service endpoint, add following code:
```js
// Apply plugin with configuration
Amplify.addPluggable(new MqttOverWSProvider({
    aws_pubsub_endpoint: 'wss://iot.eclipse.org:443/mqtt',
}));
```

You can integrate any MQTT Over WebSocket provider with your app. Click [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/protocols.html#mqtt-ws) to learn more about about MQTT Over WebSocket.

## Working with the API

### Subscribe to a topic

In order to start receiving messages from your provider, you need to subscribe to a topic as follows;
```js
PubSub.subscribe('myTopic').subscribe({
    next: data => console.log('Message received', data),
    error: error => console.error(error),
    close: () => console.log('Done'),
});
```

Following events will be triggered with `subscribe()`

Event | Description 
`next` | Triggered every time a message is successfully received for the topic
`error` | Triggered when subscription attempt fails 
`close` | Triggered when you unsubscribe from the topic

### Subscribe to multiple topics

To subscribe for multiple topics, just pass a String array including the topic names:
```js
PubSub.subscribe(['myTopic1','myTopic1']).subscribe({
    // ...
});
```

### Publish to a topic

To send a message to a topic, use `publish()` method with your topic name and the message:
```js
await PubSub.publish('myTopic1', { msg: 'Hello to all subscribers!' });
```

You can also publish a message to multiple topics:
```js
await PubSub.publish(['myTopic1','myTopic2'], { msg: 'Hello to all subscribers!' });
```

### Unsubscribe from a topic

To stop receiving messages from a topic, you can use `unsubscribe()` method:
```js
const sub1 = PubSub.subscribe('myTopicA').subscribe({
    next: data => console.log('Message received', data),
    error: error => console.error(error),
    close: () => console.log('Done'),
});

sub1.unsubscribe();
// You will no longer get messages for 'myTopicA'
```
