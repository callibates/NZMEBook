  AWS Amplify is a JavaScript library for frontend and mobile developers building cloud-enabled applications. The library is a declarative interface across different categories of operations in order to make common tasks easier to add into your application. The default implementation works with Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources but is designed to be open and pluggable for usage with other cloud services that wish to provide an implementation or custom backends.

  AWS Amplify is available as the `aws-amplify` package on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

  npm install aws-amplify --save
  ```
  
  If you are developing a [React](https://github.com/facebook/react/) app, you can install an additional package `aws-amplify-react` containing [Higher Order Components](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html):
  
  ```
  npm install aws-amplify-react --save
  ```
  
  ### React Native Development
  
  For React Native development, install `aws-amplify` 
  ```
  npm install aws-amplify --save
  ```
  If you are developing a [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) app, you can install an additional package `aws-amplify-react-native` containing [Higher Order Components](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html):
  ```
  npm install aws-amplify-react-native --save
  ```

  To link `amazon-cognito-identity-js`, you must first `eject` the project:
  
  ```bash
