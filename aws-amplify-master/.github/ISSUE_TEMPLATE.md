What is the current behavior?

If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than AWS Amplify.

What is the expected behavior?

Which versions of Amplify, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions?

You can turn on the debug mode to provide more info for us by setting ```window.LOG_LEVEL = 'DEBUG';``` in your app.
