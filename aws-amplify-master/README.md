### AWS Amplify is a JavaScript library for frontend and mobile developers building cloud-enabled applications. 

AWS Amplify provides a declarative and easy-to-use interface across different categories of cloud operations. AWS Amplify goes well with any JavaScript based frontend workflow, and React Native for mobile developers. 

Our default implementation works with Amazon Web Services (AWS), but AWS Amplify is designed to be open and pluggable for any custom backend or service.

__React Native__

For React Native development, install `aws-amplify` 

```bash
$ npm install aws-amplify --save
```

If you are developing a [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) app, you can install an additional package `aws-amplify-react-native` containing [Higher Order Components](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html):

```bash
$ npm install aws-amplify-react-native --save
```

Visit our [Installation Guide for React Native](https://aws.github.io/aws-amplify/media/install_n_config?platform=react-native) to start building your web app.  

## Configuration  

Somewhere in your app, preferably at the root level, configure Amplify with your resources.

__Using AWS Resources__

```js
import Amplify from 'aws-amplify';
import aws_exports from './aws-exports';

Amplify.configure(aws_exports);

```

__Without AWS__

```js
Amplify.configure({
  API: {
    graphql_endpoint: 'https://www.example.com/my-graphql-endpoint'
  }
});
```

## Examples

AWS Amplify supports many category scenarios such as Auth, Analytics, APIs and Storage as outlined in the [Developer Guide](https://aws.github.io/aws-amplify/media/developer_guide). A couple of samples are below:

### 1. Collect user session metrics

By default, AWS Amplify can collect user session tracking data with a few lines of code:

```js
import { Analytics } from 'aws-amplify';

Analytics.record('myCustomEvent');
```

See our [Analytics Developer Guide](https://aws.github.io/aws-amplify/media/analytics_guide) for detailed information. 

### 2. Add Authentication to your App

Add user sign up and sign in using two of the many methods available to the [Auth class](https://aws.github.io/aws-amplify/api/classes/authclass.html):

```js
import { Auth } from 'aws-amplify';

Auth.signUp({
  username: 'AmandaB',
  password: 'MyCoolPassword1!',
  attributes: {
    email: 'someemail@example.com'
  }
});

Auth.signIn(username, password)
  .then(success => console.log('successful sign in!'))
  .catch(err => console.log(err));
```

See our [Authentication Developer Guide](https://aws.github.io/aws-amplify/media/authentication_guide) for detailed information. 

__React__

Adding authentication to your React or React Native app is as easy as wrapping your app's main component with our `withAuthenticator` higher order component. AWS Amplify will provide you customizable UI for common use cases such as user registration and login.

```jsx

import { withAuthenticator } from 'aws-amplify-react-native';

export default withAuthenticator(App);
```

__Angular__

To add authentication to your Angular app you can also use the built-in service provider and components:

```js
// app.component.ts
import { AmplifyService }  from 'aws-amplify-angular';

...

constructor( public amplify:AmplifyService ) {
  // handle auth state changes
  this.amplify.authStateChange$
    .subscribe(authState => {
      this.authenticated = authState.state === 'signedIn';
      if (!authState.user) {
        this.user = null;
      } else {
        this.user = authState.user;
      }
  });
}

// app.component.html
<amplify-authenticator></amplify-authenticator>

```

See our [Angular Guide](https://aws.github.io/aws-amplify/media/angular_guide) for more details on Angular setup and usage.

### 3. Sign HTTP requests

AWS Amplify automatically signs your REST requests with [AWS Signature Version 4](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html) when using the API module :

```js
let apiName = 'MyApiName';
let path = '/path'; 
let options = {
  headers: {...} // OPTIONAL
}
API.get(apiName, path, options).then(response => {
  // Add your code here
});
```

See our [API Developer Guide](https://aws.github.io/aws-amplify/media/api_guide) for detailed information. 

### 4. GraphQL API Operations  

To access a GraphQL API with your app, you need to make sure to configure the endpoint URL in your appâ€™s configuration.

```js
// Configure a custom GraphQL endpoint
Amplify.configure({
  API: {
    graphql_endpoint: 'https://www.example.com/my-graphql-endpoint'
  }
});


// Or configure an AWS AppSync endpoint.
let myAppConfig = {
  // ...
  'aws_appsync_graphqlEndpoint': 'https://xxxxxx.appsync-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/graphql',
  'aws_appsync_region': 'us-east-1',
  'aws_appsync_authenticationType': 'API_KEY',
  'aws_appsync_apiKey': 'da2-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',
  // ...
}

Amplify.configure(myAppConfig);
```

__queries__

```js
import { API, graphqlOperation } from "aws-amplify";

const ListEvents = `query ListEvents {
  listEvents {
    items {
      id
      where
      description
    }
  }
}`;

const allEvents = await API.graphql(graphqlOperation(ListEvents));
```

__mutations__

```js
import { API, graphqlOperation } from "aws-amplify";

const CreateEvent = `mutation CreateEvent($name: String!, $when: String!, $where: String!, $description: String!) {
  createEvent(name: $name, when: $when, where: $where, description: $description) {
    id
    name
    where
    when
    description
  }
}`;

const eventDetails = {
  name: 'Party tonight!',
  when: '8:00pm',
  where: 'Ballroom',
  decription: 'Coming together as a team!'
};

const newEvent = await API.graphql(graphqlOperation(CreateEvent, eventDetails));
```

__subscriptions__

```js
import { API, graphqlOperation } from "aws-amplify";

const SubscribeToEventComments = `subscription subscribeToComments {
  subscribeToComments {
    commentId
    content
  }
}`;

const subscription = API.graphql(
  graphqlOperation(SubscribeToEventComments)
).subscribe({
  next: (eventData) => console.log(eventData)
});
```

See our [GraphQL API Developer Guide](https://aws.github.io/aws-amplify/media/api_guide#configuration-for-graphql-server) for detailed information.

### 5. Upload and Download public or private content

AWS Amplify provides an easy-to-use API to store and get content from public or private storage folders:  

```js
Storage.put(key, fileObj, {level: 'private'})
  .then (result => console.log(result))
  .catch(err => console.log(err));
      
  // Stores data with specifying its MIME type
Storage.put(key, fileObj, {
  level: 'private',
  contentType: 'text/plain'
})
.then (result => console.log(result))
.catch(err => console.log(err));
```

See our [Storage Developer Guide](https://aws.github.io/aws-amplify/media/storage_guide) for detailed information.
